### About me

I have a great desire to grow and develop in a new direction. I like what I do, because it is modern, progressive, not corny and helps me keep my brain in good shape. I am ready to learn and learn new things, to improve myself and my knowledge. In the future, I see myself as a frontend developer because i like it.
